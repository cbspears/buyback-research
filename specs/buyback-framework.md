# Buyback Analysis Framework

Standard analytical dimensions for each protocol. Every report must address these.

## 1. Revenue Model
- Revenue source(s): trading fees, MEV, lending interest, deployment fees, etc.
- Revenue denomination: ETH, stables, native token, mixed
- Revenue sustainability: is this structural or cyclical?
- Revenue growth trend: increasing, stable, declining
- Revenue concentration: diversified or single-source

## 2. Buyback Mechanics
- Allocation: what % of revenue goes to buyback
- Frequency: continuous, periodic, triggered
- Execution method: open market, AMM, OTC, auction
- Smart contract automation vs. discretionary
- Transparency: on-chain verifiable or trust-based

## 3. Token Flow Post-Buyback
- Burn (permanent supply reduction)
- Lock (time-locked, with unlock schedule)
- Redistribute (to stakers, LPs, governance participants)
- Treasury (protocol-owned, for future use)
- Hybrid (combination of above)

## 4. Quantitative Metrics
- **Buyback Yield**: (Annual buyback $ / Market cap) × 100
- **P/E Ratio**: Market cap / Annual protocol revenue
- **Revenue Per Token**: Annual revenue / Circulating supply
- **FDV/Revenue**: Fully diluted valuation / Annual revenue
- **Buyback/Float Ratio**: Annual buyback $ / (Circulating supply × price)
- **Buyback/Volume Ratio**: Daily buyback $ / Daily trading volume

## 5. Supply Dynamics
- Circulating supply vs. total supply vs. max supply
- FDV/Market cap ratio (dilution risk indicator)
- Unlock schedule: next 12 months of token unlocks
- Insider holdings: team + VC + foundation allocation
- Net emission: buyback rate vs. inflation/unlock rate

## 6. Revenue Sustainability
- Competitive position: market share, trend
- Moat assessment: network effects, switching costs, data advantages
- Bear market resilience: what happens at -90% crypto volume
- Regulatory exposure: geographic, product-type, securities risk
- Dependency risk: single-chain, single-product, key-person

## 7. Comparable Analysis
- P/E relative to category peers
- Buyback yield relative to category peers
- Revenue growth relative to category peers
- Revenue multiple relative to TradFi comparables

## 8. Structural Moat Assessment
- Switching costs (high/medium/low with explanation)
- Network effects (direct, indirect, data)
- Forkability risk (can the protocol be trivially forked?)
- Regulatory moat (compliance as barrier to entry)
- Brand/reputation moat

## 9. Governance & Team
- Team track record and reputation
- Governance structure (token voting, multisig, council)
- Governance activity (proposal frequency, participation rate)
- Alignment between team incentives and token holders

## 10. Key Risks
- Smart contract risk (audit status, complexity, TVL at risk)
- Competitive risk (emerging competitors, fork risk)
- Regulatory risk (jurisdiction, product classification)
- Macro risk (cyclicality, rate sensitivity)
- Concentration risk (whale holders, single market maker)
