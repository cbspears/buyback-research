## Methodology Notes

- Discovery scan runs every 3rd iteration
- Each iteration targets one protocol
- 5 analyst personas run in parallel per protocol
- Reports follow specs/report-template.md format
- Data collected: DefiLlama (revenue/fees), CoinGecko (market data), Snapshot (governance)

## Known Issues / Gaps

- Some protocols may not have DefiLlama slugs configured — check src/collectors/defillama.py
- CoinGecko free tier has rate limits — be patient
- Snapshot spaces not configured for all protocols — some use custom governance
- On-chain collector is minimal — expand per-protocol as needed
- Python collectors require outbound internet — if running offline, data must be collected via web search subagents
- DefiLlama API DNS resolution failed during Jito iteration (fees.llama.fi) — web research subagents used as fallback. Consider adding cached responses or alternative API endpoints.

## Research Questions (Accumulated)

- How do buyback yields compare to traditional equity buyback yields?
- Is there a relationship between buyback announcement and token price action?
- Do protocols with higher FDV/MCap ratios have less effective buybacks (dilution overwhelms)?
- What is the optimal buyback frequency — continuous vs. periodic?
- How do bear market conditions affect buyback program sustainability?
- (From HYPE analysis) Does the unlock-to-buyback ratio provide a generalizable metric for buyback effectiveness?
- (From HYPE analysis) Should protocols retain treasury reserves before initiating buybacks? What is the optimal reserve-to-buyback allocation?
- (From HYPE analysis) How does "vertically integrated app with own L1" differ from "true fat protocol" for buyback sustainability?
- (From HYPE analysis) Can team wallet behavior be monitored systematically as a signal for buyback quality?
- (From JUP analysis) How should buyback programs handle concurrent insider unlock schedules? Is there a minimum buyback/unlock coverage ratio below which buybacks are counterproductive?
- (From JUP analysis) Lock vs burn: are there any scenarios where locking purchased tokens is preferable to burning? Or is this always a design error?
- (From JUP analysis) The Mercurial offset pattern — how common are near-perfect buyback/vesting offsets across protocols? Is this a systematic feature of buyback programs with concurrent vesting?
- (From JUP analysis) Application-layer vs infrastructure-layer buybacks: does Monegro's forkability thesis hold empirically? Need to compare Jupiter (app) vs Hyperliquid (L1) outcomes.
- (From JUP analysis) Pro-cyclical buyback failure: can countercyclical buyback designs (accumulate treasury in bull, deploy in bear) be implemented programmatically?
- (From JUP analysis) Does the pivot from buyback to emission control (Net-Zero) represent a generalizable pattern for protocols that discover buybacks are insufficient?
- (From ENA analysis) Can revenue models that cross zero (go negative) ever sustain buyback programs? Is there a minimum revenue floor requirement?
- (From ENA analysis) SPAC-as-buyback-vehicle: is StablecoinX a one-off experiment or a template? What are the regulatory implications of Nasdaq-listed entities accumulating DeFi governance tokens?
- (From ENA analysis) Hold vs burn: does holding purchased tokens in a treasury vehicle create worse outcomes than Jupiter's Litterbox Trust lock model? Both failed — is "not burning" always a design error?
- (From ENA analysis) Fee switch vs buyback: when both mechanisms are available, does running them in parallel create capital allocation incoherence? Is there evidence that fee switches alone outperform fee switch + buyback combinations?
- (From ENA analysis) Buyback & Distribute (GMX model) vs Buyback & Burn vs Buyback & Hold: systematic comparison needed across all three token flow models.
- (From ENA analysis) Conditional/adaptive buybacks (Lido NEST, Aave adaptive weekly) vs flat-rate buybacks: do triggers and conditions improve outcomes?
- (From Discovery) Supply compression leaders — Gains Network (25.7%) and GMX (12.9%) are dramatically ahead. Is there an inflection point where supply compression becomes reflexively positive?
- (From Discovery) MakerDAO/Sky buyback scaling ($370K → $97M in one year, 262x increase) — what drove this and is it replicable?
- (From JTO analysis) Infrastructure-layer moat vs token value accrual: can a protocol have a dominant infrastructure position (95%+ penetration) while the governance token still fails to capture value? What additional mechanisms (veToken, fee distribution, burns) are necessary?
- (From JTO analysis) The CSD "treasury as insider bid" dynamic: when buybacks run against live vesting schedules, does the DAO systematically subsidize insider exit? Is there a minimum vesting-completion threshold before buybacks become value-accretive?
- (From JTO analysis) Forkability at the infrastructure layer: Paladin forked Jito-Solana and eroded MEV share from 75% to 60% in 6 months. Does the JitoSOL flywheel (DeFi composability, TVL gravity) create a sufficient second moat, or will MEV infrastructure commoditize?
- (From JTO analysis) Revenue denomination matters: Jito earns in SOL (hard asset) but converts to JTO (governance token) via buyback. Is this trade-down from hard asset to soft asset always value-destructive, or can it compound if the governance token appreciates?
- (From JTO analysis) The "buyback and barter" model (inter-DAO token swaps): does distributing purchased tokens to partner DAOs create more durable demand than burning? Soft lock-up through relationships vs hard lock-up through code.
- (From ETHFI analysis) Buyback-to-unlock ratio as a universal metric: Ether.fi's buyback absorbs 12-30% of unlock pressure (8.5x sell pressure vs buy pressure). Is there a minimum ratio below which buybacks are net-negative (providing exit liquidity for insiders while consuming treasury)?
- (From ETHFI analysis) Nominal-price triggers vs valuation-based triggers: the $3 trigger is permanently active at $0.46. Should buyback triggers be P/E-based or revenue-multiple-based rather than nominal-price-based? Would this produce better capital allocation outcomes?
- (From ETHFI analysis) Counter-cyclical withdrawal fee buybacks: Ether.fi's withdrawal fees fund buybacks during panic exits — a rare counter-cyclical element. How material is this in practice? Does it represent a generalizable design pattern for staking protocols?
- (From ETHFI analysis) The "neobank escape hatch" — when DeFi middleware protocols pivot to consumer fintech (Cash cards, hotel bookings), does this create sufficient non-crypto-correlated revenue to sustain buybacks through crypto winters? Or does crypto card spending collapse in bear markets too?
- (From ETHFI analysis) Distribute-to-stakers vs burn for application-layer tokens: all 5 analysts agreed distribute is correct for non-monetary tokens. Is there empirical evidence that distribution creates more sustainable demand than burns at the application layer?
- (From ETHFI analysis) Capital allocation at the inflection point: Hasu argues buyback capital should be redirected to Cash Card growth. When should protocols shift from "return capital" to "reinvest for growth"? Is there a revenue-to-FDV ratio that determines the optimal switch?
- (From ETHFI analysis) Ecosystem embeddedness as a moat against forkability: weETH's 400+ DeFi integrations create switching friction at the ecosystem level (not user level). How durable is this moat compared to L1 network effects? Historical precedents?
- (From PUMP analysis) Does 100% buyback allocation signal the absence of a capital allocation strategy rather than maximum shareholder alignment? When a protocol has no treasury, no governance, and no reserves, is "100% to buyback" a red flag?
- (From PUMP analysis) Buyback as exit liquidity: the $86.4M insider dump following a $30M buyback wave is the clearest documented case. How prevalent is this pattern? Can it be detected programmatically by monitoring buyback wallet activity vs insider transfers?
- (From PUMP analysis) ICO-to-buyback pipeline: when a protocol raises $1.3B in an ICO and then uses 100% of operating revenue to buy back the token it just sold, is this structurally circular? Does the ICO create the very sell pressure the buyback must absorb?
- (From PUMP analysis) Casino revenue and buyback sustainability: Pump.fun's revenue is perfectly correlated with memecoin speculation. Is there a revenue source durability threshold below which buybacks are always value-destructive? How should "casino" revenue be discounted vs "utility" revenue?
- (From PUMP analysis) Average buyback price as a diagnostic: PUMP's avg buyback at $0.004-0.006 vs current $0.0021 means 50-65% value destruction. Across all protocols studied, is "buyback underwater on cost basis" a reliable indicator of mechanism failure?
- (From PUMP analysis) The reflexivity trap: Pump.fun's bull-market feedback loop (meme mania → revenue → buybacks → price → attention → more memes) reverses with equal ferocity in bear markets. Can any mechanism design break the reflexivity, or is it inherent to pro-cyclical revenue + buyback?
- (From Discovery) Investor-funded vs revenue-funded buybacks: MANTRA's $25M investor buyback tranche is fundamentally different from revenue-funded buybacks. Should these be analyzed separately? Do investor buybacks create moral hazard?
